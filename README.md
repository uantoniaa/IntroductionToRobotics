## RGB LED Control with Potentiometers


The homework contains:
  - The project requirements and description; 
  - A photo of the hardware setup;
  - A link to the video showcasing the functionality;
  - A link to the uploaded code;
 

### Objective
* Interface potentiometers with Arduino to control an RGB LED's individual channels - Red, Green, Blue.
* Learn to harness analog readings from potentiometers and utilize digital electronics techniques for LED control.
* Adhere to a consistent and clean coding style, ensuring the code is well-commented and easily understandable by peers and reviewers.

  
### Components Used
* 1 RGB LED 
* 3 potentiometers 
* Resistors and wires as necessary


### Technical Implementation
* Control each RGB channel of the LED using dedicated potentiometers.
* The Arduino interprets the analog readings from the potentiometers and then produces a mapped output to the RGB LED pins for precise color adjustments.


### Photos of the Hardware Setup
* A detailed view of the Arduino setup on a breadboard with the illuminated LED indicating its active state.
