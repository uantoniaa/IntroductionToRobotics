    Homework 1 : RGB LED Control with Potentiometers
  </summary>  

## RGB LED Control with Potentiometers

### Objective
* Interface potentiometers with Arduino to control an RGB LED's individual channels - Red, Green, Blue.
* Learn to harness analog readings from potentiometers and utilize digital electronics techniques for LED control.
* Adhere to a consistent and clean coding style, ensuring the code is well-commented and easily understandable by peers and reviewers.
### Components Used
* 1 RGB LED 
* 3 potentiometers 
* Resistors and wires as necessary

### Technical Implementation
* Control each RGB channel of the LED using dedicated potentiometers.
* The Arduino interprets the analog readings from the potentiometers and then produces a mapped output to the RGB LED pins for precise color adjustments.

### Documentation & Publishing
* The code related to this project has been uploaded to this repository.
* The repository’s README (which you are currently viewing) contains:
  - The project requirements and description.
  - A photo of the hardware setup.
  - A link to the video showcasing the functionality.
